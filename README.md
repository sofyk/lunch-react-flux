# Lunch

An interactive fiction game that lets you stroll through the conversation a couple is having at a restaurant.

***

## About:

Lunch is a game about a couple that is having an argument that is entirely unrelated to the actual issues troubling the relationship. It is about two people reading into things, yet never stating their mind. At least not during that lunch. It will be up to the player to figure out what actually troubles the relationship.

## Development:

The app was written using React and Flux. Most of the stuff used here I learned from Plurasight's [Building Applications with React and Flux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-flux-building-applications/description) by [Cory House](https://github.com/coryhouse).

## Developer:

Lunch is developed and written by me, Sofy K. I am a software developer by day, a short story writer by night, and a game designer by daydream. I am fascinated by interactive narrative, and I plan t hone this skill with endless practice.
